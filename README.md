# Learning Haskell
This repo is to organize resources, projects, notes, and exercises for learning Haskell, functional programming, and the lambda calculus.

## Installation
Instructions for installing Haskell can be found here: [haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/)

## Quick Start
After you have finished the installation, open the Haskell interpreter ghci in a shell like so:

```SHELL
gchi
```

This will place you inside of a Haskell REPL. 

Here are things to run to get your feet wet right away. (Examples adapted from [haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/))


```HASKELL
23 * 36
```
```HASKELL
reverse "hello"
```
```HASKELL
foldr (:) [] [1,2,3]
```
```HASKELL
:t 23
```
```HASKELL
:t (+)
```

## Example Function - Prime Generator

*WATCH OUT:* Since Haskell is lazily evaluated, the line `filterPrime [2..]` will create a generator that will potentially run indefinitely. 

Unless you want that, (which you probably don't) don't call `primes` in the following block without `take n` where `n` is some positive integer.

(If you run it anyway, then use a keyboard interrupt (`ctr+D`) to stop it when you've had your fill of watching the world burn. If that doesn't work, then force quit your shell.)

```HASKELL
filterPrime (p:xs) = p : filterPrime [x | x <- xs, x `mod` p /= 0]
primes = filterPrime [2..]
take 10 primes
```
As noted on the original example at [haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/), this is not to be taken as a serious prime number generator, but rather as an illustration of some of Haskell's features.

## GHCUP

If you use [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/) to manage your Haskell installation, you can get a summary of the installations on your machine in the terminal:

```shell
ghcup tui
```

## Resources
Books, videos, blog posts, and other materials useful for learning Haskell and related topics will be added in [learning-haskell/resources/](https://github.com/jllovet/learning-haskell/tree/master/resources).
